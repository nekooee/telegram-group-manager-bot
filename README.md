## Features

### Scheduled Message Deletion

Add the bot to your group or channel, then you can set messages to be deleted automatically after a specific time.

**How to use:**

* Reply to the message you want to delete and send:

  ```
  /del
  ```

  This will delete the message after 24 hours by default (configurable in the `config.py` file).

* To specify a custom time, use the format:

  ```
  /del 1h
  /del 30m
  /del 7d
  ```

  where
  `d` = days
  `h` = hours
  `m` = minutes

The maximum allowed time for scheduling message deletion is **10 days (240 hours)**. If the specified time exceeds this limit, the default `DELETE_AFTER_HOURS` value from the config will be used instead.

### Image Conversion to JPG

The bot supports converting certain image formats specified in the config file.

**How to use:**

* Reply to the message containing the image you want to convert and send:

  ```
  /tojpg
  ```

  This will convert the image and upload it as a **file**.

* If you want the converted image to be uploaded as a **regular photo**, send:

  ```
  /tojpg photo
  ```

The conversion quality is set to 90% by default, balancing image quality and file size.

## Running the Bot on Ubuntu or AlmaLinux

Before starting the bot for the first time:

1. **Move the bot files to a folder on your server and navigate to that folder**:

   ```bash
   mkdir ~/telegram-bot
   mv /path/to/your/files/* ~/telegram-bot/
   cd ~/telegram-bot
   ```

2. **Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the contents** with your desired environment variables:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   nano .env
   ```

   > Make sure to set values such as your bot token and other required configurations.

3. Create and activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Install required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Then, to run the bot and keep it running even after closing the terminal, you can use either `screen` or `nohup`.

### Using `screen`

1. Install screen if not installed:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install screen    # Ubuntu
   sudo dnf install screen    # AlmaLinux
   ```

2. Start a new screen session:

   ```bash
   screen -S telegrambot
   ```

3. Activate your virtual environment and start the bot:

   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   python group_manager_bot.py
   ```

4. To detach from the screen session (leave it running):

   Press `Ctrl + A` then `D`

5. To resume the screen session later:

   ```bash
   screen -r telegrambot
   ```

### Using `nohup`

1. Activate your virtual environment:

   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Start the bot in the background:

   ```bash
   nohup python group_manager_bot.py > bot.log 2>&1 &
   ```

   This will keep the bot running after you close the terminal. Logs will be written to `bot.log`.

3. To check if itâ€™s running:

   ```bash
   ps aux | grep group_manager_bot.py
   ```

4. To stop the bot later, find the PID and kill it:

   ```bash
   kill <PID>
   ```
